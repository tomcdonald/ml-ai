    "# Probability and an Introduction to Jupyter, Python and Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "### 30th September 2019 modified by Mauricio A Álvarez\n",

    "### 29th September 2015 Neil Lawrence\n",

    "Welcome to the Machine Learning and Adaptive Intelligence course. In this course we will introduce the basic concepts of machine learning and data science. In particular we will look at tools and techniques that describe how to model. An integrated part of that is how we approach data with the computer. We are choosing to do that with the tool you see in front of you: the Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook provides us with a way of interacting with the data that allows us to give the computer instructions and explore the nature of a data set. It is *different* to normal coding, but it is related. In this course you will, through intensive practical sessions and labs, develop your understanding of the interaction between data and computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we are going to do is ask you to forget a bit about what you think about normal programming, or 'classical software engineering'. Classical software engineering demands a large amount of design and testing. In data analysis, testing remains very important, but the design is often evolving. The design evolves through a process known as *exploratory data analysis*. You will learn some of the techniques of exploratory data analysis in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular difference between classical software engineering and data analysis is the way in which programs are run. Classically we spend a deal of time working with a text editor, writing code. Compilations are done on a regular basis and aspects of the code are tested (perhaps with unit tests). \n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis is more like coding in a debugger. In a debugger (particularly a visual debugger) you interact with the data stored in the memory of the computer to try and understand what is happening in the computer, you need to understand exactly what your bug is: you often have a fixed idea of what the program is trying to do, you are just struggling to find out why it isn't doing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, debugging is an important part of data analysis also, but in some sense it can be seen as its entire premise. You load in a data set into a computer that you don't understand, your entire objective is to understand the data. This is best done by interogating the data to visualise it or summarize it, just like in a power visual debugger. However, for data science the requirements for visualization and summarization are far greater than in a regular program. When the data is well understood, the actual number of lines of your program may well be very few (particularly if you disregard commands that load in the data and commands which plot your results). If a powerful data science library is available, you may be able to summarize your code with just two or three lines, but the amount of intellectual energy that is expended on writing those three lines is far greater than in standard code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first lecture we will think a little about 'how we got here' in terms of computer science. In the lecture itself, this will be done by taking a subjective perspective, that of my own 'data autobiography'."

    "## Assumed Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Algebra, Probability and Differential Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be assuming that you have good background in maths. In particular we will be making use of linear algrebra (matrix operations including inverse, inner products, determinant etc), probability (sum rule of probability, product rule of probability), and the calculus of differentiation (and integration!). A new concept for the course is multivariate differentiation and integration. This combines linear algebra and differential calculus. These techniques are vital in understanding probability distributions over high dimensional distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice of Language\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will be using Python for our programming language. A prerequisite of attending this course is that you have learnt at least one programming language in the past. It is not our objective to teach you python. At Level 4 and Masters we expect our students to be able pick up a language as they go. If you have not experienced python before it may be worth your while spending some time understanding the language. There are resources available for you to do this [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/) that are based on the standard console. An introduction to the Jupyter notebook (formerly known as the IPython notebook) is available [here](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/notebook/index.html). "

    "Python was invented by Guido van Rossum as a higher level language designed to bridge the gap between C and the shell. The origin of the name is the Monty Python series, of which Guido is a fan. The language is interpreted and object orientated, although can be used for other programming paradigms (imperative etc.)."

We will be learning how to make use of the notebook throughout the course. The notebook allows us to combine code with descriptions, interactive visualizations, plots etc. In fact it allows us to do many of the things we need for data science. Notebooks can also be easily shared through the internet for ease of communication of ideas. The box this text is written in is a *markdown* box. Below we have a *code* box."

    "Here we are using the command `film_deaths['Body_Count']>200` to index the films in the pandas data frame which have over 200 deaths. To sort them in order we can also use the `sort` command. The result of this command on its own is a data series of `True` and `False` values. However, when it is passed to the `film_deaths` data frame it returns a new data frame which contains only those values for which the data series is `True`. We can also sort the result. To sort the result by the values in the `Body_Count` column in *descending* order we use the following command."

Matplotlib is a plotting library which allows for data visualisation. SciPy is a scientific programming package which provides a large range of mathematical functionality, including linear algebra, calculus, statistics and image/signal processing. Pandas is a package designed for data science which introduces a data structure called a DataFrame, which is similar to a NumPy array but has various features designed to make exploratory data analysis and data science easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pylab is a package which incorporates parts of NumPy and matplotlib, but isn't widely used anymore as it's not Pythonic, doesn't integrate well with other packages used for data analytics and relies on a MATLAB style approach to data analysis in general."

    "Note a few things. We are interacting with our data. In particular, we are replotting the data according to what we have learned so far. We are using the progamming language as a *scripting* language to give the computer one command or another, and then the next command we enter is dependent on the result of the previous. This is a very different paradigm to classical software engineering. In classical software engineering we normally write many lines of code (entire object classes or functions) before compiling the code and running it. Our approach is more similar to the approach we take whilst debugging. Historically, researchers interacted with data using a *console*. A command line window which allowed command entry. The notebook format we are using is slightly different. Each of the code entry boxes acts like a separate console window. We can move up and down the notebook and run each part in a different order. The *state* of the program is always as we left it after running the previous part.  "

    "A probability distribution expresses uncertainty about the outcome of an event. We often encode this uncertainty in a variable. So if we are considering the outcome of an event, $Y$, to be a coin toss, then we might consider $Y=1$ to be heads and $Y=0$ to be tails. We represent the probability of a given outcome with the notation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y=1) = 0.5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The first rule of probability is that the probability must normalize. The sum of the probability of all events must equal 1. So if the probability of heads ($Y=1$) is 0.5, then the probability of tails (the only other possible outcome) is given by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y=0) = 1-P(Y=1) = 0.5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilities are often defined as the limit of the ratio between the number of positive outcomes (e.g. *heads*) given the number of trials. If the number of positive outcomes for event $y$ is denoted by $n_y$ and the number of trials is denoted by $N$ then this gives the ratio \n",

    "There are likely groups of film genres which involve very few deaths (Rom-Coms etc.), so the probability of these films containing over 40 deaths is likely much lower than 38%.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Conditioning\n",
    "\n",
    "When predicting whether a coin turns up head or tails, we might think that this event is *independent* of the year or time of day. If we include an observation such as time, then in a probability this is known as *conditioning*. We use this notation, $P(Y=y|T=t)$, to condition the outcome on a second variable (in this case time). Or, often, for a shorthand we use $P(y|t)$ to represent this distribution (the $Y=$ and $T=$ being implicit). Because we don't believe a coin toss depends on time then we might write that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(y|t) = p(y).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "However, we might believe that the number of deaths is dependent on the year. For this we can try estimating $P(Y>40 | T=2000)$ and compare the result, for example to $P(Y>40|2002)$ using our empirical estimate of the probability."

A better estimate could be created with the help of a more exhaustive database, with more films, from a range of different years."

Computing a joint probability is equivalent to answering the simultaneous questions, what's the probability that the number of deaths was over 40 and the year was 2002? Or any other question that may occur to us. Again we can easily use pandas to ask such questions.\n"
